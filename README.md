# ðŸ“Š Population Data Explorer

## ðŸš€ Instructions

Using [`https://datausa.io/about/api/`](https://datausa.io/about/api/), follow the directions below and create a few pages to show the user Census data. At the end, you should have two pages (Nation and States) that each display Census data at differents levels.

1. **Component Rendering**  
   - Use `routes.js` to render the available components dynamically

2. **National Population Page**  
   - Display the population for the entire nation using a list
      - Columns should be "Year" and "Population"
   - The list should initially show the **5 most recent years** along with their populations
   - The user should have an option to edit their list and customize which years are visible using a modal, checkboxes, and submit

3. **State Population Page**  
   - Display a table showing each state with its corresponding population
      - Columns should be "State" and "Population"
      - The table should initially show the census data for the most recent year
   - Using a select dropdown, allow the user to choose a year of census data
      - The dropdown should only have years with corresponding census data
      - These options should be **dynamically generated** and not hardcoded
   - Add the ability to sort by Population (ascending, descending, and unsorted)

   
**BONUS**:
   - Format population numbers with commas at each thousandths place (e.g., `1,000,000`)
   - Add the ability to sort by Population (ascending, descending, and unsorted)
   - Style the navigation hyperlinks to appear as MUI Buttons side-by-side
